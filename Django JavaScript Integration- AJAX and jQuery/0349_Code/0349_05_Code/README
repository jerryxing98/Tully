Code samples included are all from a Django project. They are:

admin.py:

    Administrative functions that should be run exactly once.

functions.py:

    A file for defining functions for this website, presently including one
    decorator.

views.py

    A file containing Django views.

search.html

    The present WIP for the search page. The JavaScript should probably be
    refactored once it's working, and moved off to its own file.
